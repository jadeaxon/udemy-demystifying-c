1. Marks of 3 subjects are input through the keyboard. Write a program to print total and percentile marks
for 3 students using any appropriate loop control structure
2. Write a program to print sum of integers. At the beginning user will be asked how many numbers he is
going to enter. The output should be sum of all numbers entered by the user. (For example if user enters
6 at the beginning, then user will be prompted to enter 6 integers)
3. Write a program to print factorial of any positive integer entered by the user through the keyboard.
4. Write a C program to print multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10
5. Two integer numbers are input through the keyboard. Write a C program to print one number raised to
other number. For example if user enters 4 and 3 then output should be 4 raised to 3
6. An integer is entered through the keyboard. Write a program to print whether number entered is prime
or not
7. Write a C program to print first n numbers of Fibonacci series where n is the value given by the user. For
example if user enters 6 then output should be 0…1…1….2….3…..5
8. Write a C program to print all Armstrong numbers between 0 and number entered by the user. For
example if user enters 500 then output would be all Armstrong numbers between 0 and 500. (If sum of
cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is an Armstrong
number) For example 153 = (1* 1 * 1) + (5 * 5 * 5) + (3 * 3 * 3)
9. Write a C program to calculate and print cube of a number entered by the user. Make a provision that
user can enter as many numbers as he/she wants.
10. Write a program to print all prime numbers between 0 and 500.
11. Write a C program find and print highest marks in the class for particular subject using loop. Make
arrangement to accept marks of as many students as user wishes.
12. Write a C program to print sum of odd positive integers up to 75…
